# Hedges-Detection

Anonymous repo for the paper "You might think about slightly revising the title": identifying hedges in peer-tutoring interactions. 

As mentioned in the paper, a NDA was signed with the participant, preventing us from releasing the dataset. We also cannot include the LIWC 2015 dictionnary, since it is a proprietery software (https://liwcsoftware.onfastspring.com/). 

A file containing the configuration used for the different models is joined.

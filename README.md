# Hedges-Detection

Repo for the paper "You might think about slightly revising the title": identifying hedges in peer-tutoring interactions

The IRB agreement does not allow us to release the dataset. We also cannot include the LIWC 2015 dictionnary, since it is a proprietery software (https://liwcsoftware.onfastspring.com/). 

A file containing the configuration used for the different models is joined. 

Link to a video example from the dataset, showing three occurences of each hedge classes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CbC6t8WeoE (The participants have consented to their recordings being used for illustrative purposes).
